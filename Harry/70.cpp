# Containers
1. Sequence containers  : Linear fashion me data storage. ex:- vector, list, dequeue.
2. Associative containers: Direct access. ex:- set, multiset, map, multimap.
3. Derived containers   : Real world Modelling. ex:- stack, queue, priority queue.


# Sequence Containers
1. Vectors
-> Random Access Fast   (comparitive to array)
-> Mid Insertion / Deletion (slow)
-> Insertion at the end = fast

2. List
-> Random Access Slow
-> Mid Insertion / Deletion fast
-> Insertion / Deletion at the end fast

# Associative containers
-> All opetions fast except the Random Access (bcz of store data in tree model)

# Derived Containers
-> Depends ==> Data Structures.
